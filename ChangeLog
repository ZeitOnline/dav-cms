	* mod_dav_cms.c (dav_cms_create_server_conf): Changed
	  module initialisation and moved patching of dav provider
	  hooks into an independent function. This function is called
	  during module hookregistration time -- not the most natural
	  place but it seems to work.

	* dav_cms_props.c (dav_cms_db_store): Added some dummy
	  functionality to fake db_open, db_store and db_fetch.
	  Fixed nasty segfault bug caused by strange incomplete
	  typedef in mod_dav.h.
